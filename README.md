## 🔑 Core Features

### 🔐 1. Secure Identity Onboarding
- Upload ID documents or selfies
- Cryptographically hash personal data (SHA-256)
- Anchor proofs to the XRP Ledger (no raw PII stored)

### 🔎 2. Decentralized Verification
- Identity bound to wallet address or verification token
- Verifiers can confirm identity status via immutable XRPL records
- Role-based verifier/admin access (e.g. for KYC)

### 🧠 3. AI-Powered Behavior Monitoring
- Tracks IP, geolocation, device fingerprint
- Flags anomalies using lightweight AI models
- Blocks suspicious activity before it escalates

### 💼 4. Wallet-Native UX
- Login and verify via **Xumm Wallet**
- Sign identity proofs and verifications
- Identity ownership linked directly to XRPL wallets

### 🎨 5. Clean, Responsive Interface
- Built with **Next.js App Router** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Mobile-first, intuitive, accessible
- Designed for clarity, speed, and trust
