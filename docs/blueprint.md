# **App Name**: IDyn

## Core Features:

- Secure Onboarding: Users begin by registering with their personal data through a secure onboarding process. They can upload government-issued ID documents, selfies, or other credentials. The system generates a cryptographic hash of the identity data (using SHA-256 or equivalent) and stores the hashed proof immutably on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), ensuring tamper-proof digital identity records. No raw identity data is stored off-chain.

- Document/image hashing and proof generation

- Data minimization to meet privacy regulations

- Front-end form validation and feedback

- Optional integration with third-party ID verification (e.g., OCR, liveness)
- Decentralized Identity Verification: IDyn enables third-party verifiers (banks, platforms, healthcare providers) to verify a user's identity through a decentralized process. The verifier enters the user's wallet address or unique verification token to retrieve and validate the corresponding identity proof from XRPL.

- Verification by wallet address or token

- Smart contract logic or ledger query to confirm identity match

- Public proof with private data privacy

- Visual verification status (e.g., Verified, Pending, Invalid)
- Wallet Integration: IDyn integrates with Xumm Wallet (or other XRPL-compatible wallets) for secure authentication and blockchain interaction. Users can sign transactions or identity requests without exposing private keys. Wallets are used both for identity anchoring and ongoing proof of control.

- Sign-up/login via wallet

- Identity binding to XRPL address

- Transaction signing for publishing identity hash

- Testnet and mainnet-ready
- AI-Powered Behavior Monitoring: To prevent unauthorized access and impersonation, IDyn includes an AI-based tool behavior analysis system. It collects behavioral metrics (IP address, geolocation, browser fingerprint) at login and registration, and flags anomalies using a lightweight anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest or k-NN).

- Real-time fraud risk scoring

- Alerts for suspicious login patterns

- Optional CAPTCHA or step-up verification

- AI model improves over time with usage
- User Dashboard & Verification Status: Users can log in to view and manage their verification status. The dashboard displays whether their identity is verified, pending, or flagged. It also provides a history of verification events and access logs.

- Status badge (Verified / In Review / Flagged)

- Timestamped logs of access or verification

- Optional ability to revoke or refresh identity proof
- Verifier/Admin Portal: Organizations or admins can use a secure portal to search, view, and validate user identities. This portal provides access logs, user data hashes, and tools to export compliance reports (e.g., for KYC, onboarding).

- User lookup by wallet, token, or name

- CSV export of verification results

- Admin-only access with role-based permissions

- Logging of verifier activity
- Responsive & Accessible UI: A user-friendly, mobile-first interface built with clarity and accessibility in mind. Clean layout, intuitive actions, and visual feedback guide users through onboarding, identity verification, and security alerts.

- Grid-based layout

- Mobile responsiveness

- Clean icons for ID-related actions

- Subtle transitions and animations

- Accessibility support (color contrast, keyboard nav)
- Privacy & Compliance by Design: IDyn is designed with privacy at its core. Personally identifiable information (PII) is never stored on-chain. All identity data is hashed before storage, and only the proofs are published. The platform is aligned with GDPR and other data protection regulations.

- No raw data stored off-chain or on-chain

- Support for user consent & data control

- Compliance flags for healthcare/finance integrations

- Transparent user terms and policy notices

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey security, trust, and innovation.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#ECEFF1) to create a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight key actions and information.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text, paired with 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headings, to combine clarity with a modern feel.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that are easy to understand to represent identity-related concepts.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain structure and readability across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback on user actions and guide users through the verification process.
